Displaying and fetching quotes from an api
● Make an api GET request (url: https://api.kanye.rest/) (NOTE:Everytime it gives you a different quote in the response). ● After every one second make a GET request to the above api for five seconds. ● Store the response of each api call to an array. ● Find the longest quote. ● Find the longest word used amongst all quotes. ● Add one extra property 'isBoring' to all fetched quotes, if the quote length is greater than 20, the value for ‘isBoring’ will be true otherwise it will be false.
